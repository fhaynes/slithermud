Make sure you have Python 2.3 or above installed. Twisted does not yet work with 2.5, so I recomend using 2.4

For Slither to run, you must install Twisted. It is available here: http://twistedmatrix.com

Change the home_dir variable in MudConst.py to match where you install it.

On windows, you can put SlitherMUD in C:\Slither and it should run fine. If you are on linux, and you put it in /home/user/bob, change the variable to /home/user/bob. 

I've tested it on both Windows XP and SuSE 10.1. Any problems, post on the forum or send me an email.

Use the dos2unix utility to convert the line endings on all the files (including the zne and template files) if you have problems with that on linux.
